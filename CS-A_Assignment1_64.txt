3. tail <file> :To display last 10 lines of file
Ex tail -3 fname ; tail –c 100 fname

Ex cut –c 2-10,12-14 fname
a. cut –d “|” –f 2,4 fname
5. paste <file1> <file2> :To combine two file vertically rather than horizontally

Ex paste –d “|” fname1 fname2
6. sort <file>:To sort file in order by field wise
Ex sort –t”|” –k 2 fname
a. sort –r fname
7. uniq <file> :Locate repeated & nonrepeated
lines Ex uniq fname; uniq –d fname
8. tr ch1 ch2 < <file1>:To translate occurrence of ch1 by ch2
Ex tr ‘|’ ‘+’ < fname1
9.

tee: read from standard input and write to standard output and files
Ex. ls *.txt | wc -l | tee count.txt

File permission: Use the chmod command to change file permissions
1. Changing permission relative manner
Category

Operation

Perm.

u-user

+ assign

r-read

g-group

- removal

w-write

o-other

= assign abs perm.

x-execute

a-all
Syntax: chmod category operation perm. <file>
Ex chmod u+x fname
chmod a+x fname
chmod u-x fname
chmod a-x,go+r fname
2. Changing permission absolute
manner Read=4
Write =2
Execute=1
Ex chmod 666 fname
chmod 644 fname
chmod -R 644

Change owner & group
Syntax: chown options owner files
Ex chown “xyz” fname

Syntax: chgrp options group files
Ex chgrp “xyz” fname

Redirection: Provide a powerful command line controls
Most Linux commands read input, such as a file or another attribute for the command,
and write output. By default, input is being given with the keyboard, and output is
displayed on your screen. Your keyboard is your standard input (stdin) device, and the
screen or a particular terminal window is the standard output (stdout) device
There are 3 types of redirection available in linux
1.

Standard input redirection: It is used to redirect standard

input. Ex. cat < fname
2.

Standard output redirection : It is used to redirect standard

output. Ex cat >fname
3.

Standard error redirection: It is used to redirect standard

error. Ex cat fname 2>Errorfile

Pipe
Connects commands so the output of one becomes input for the second
Vertical bar(|) is the pipe operator.
Ex. ls -l | more
cat file1 file2 | sort > file3
Concatenates file1 and file2
Sends the result to the sort command
Store the alphabetized, concatenate result as a new file called file3

Grep: Global regular expression print
Searching and pattern matching tools
Searches files for one or more pattern arguments. It does plain string, basic regular
expression, and extended regular expression searching
Following are some of the options for grep
-i ignore case for matching
-v doesn’t display lines matching expression
-n display line numbers along of occurrences

-c counting number of occurrences
-l display list of file names
-e exp for matching
-f file take patterns from file
-E treat pattern as an extended reg. exp
-F matches multiple fixed strings (fgrep)

Problems to be solved in the lab:
1. Change your password to a password you would like to use for the remainder of the
semester
2. Display the system’s date.

3. Count the number of lines in the /etc/passwd file.

4. Find out who else is on the system.

5. Direct the output of the man pages for the date command to a file named mydate.

6. Create a subdirectory called mydir.

7. Move the file mydate into the new subdirectory.

8. Go to the subdirectory mydir and copy the file mydate to a new file called ourdate

9. List the contents of mydir.

10. Do a long listing on the file ourdate and note the permissions.

11. Display the name of the current directory starting from the root.

12. Move the files in the directory mydir back to your home directory.

13. Display the first 5 lines of mydate.

14. Display the last 8 lines of mydate.

15. Remove the directory mydir.

16. Redirect the output of the long listing of files to a file named list.

17. Select any 5 capitals of states in India and enter them in a file named capitals1. Choose 5
more capitals and enter them in a file named capitals2. Choose 5 more capitals and enter
them in a file named capitals3. Concatenate all 3 files and redirect the output to a file named
capitals.

18. Concatenate the file capitals2 at the end of file capitals.

19. Give read and write permissions to all users for the file capitals.

20. Give read permissions only to the owner of the file capitals. Open the file, make some
changes and try to save it. What happens?
21. Create an alias to concatenate the 3 files capitals1, capitals2, capitals3 and redirect the
output to a file named capitals. Activate the alias and make it run.

22. Find out the number of times the string “the” appears in the file mydate.

23. Find out the line numbers on which the string “date” exists in mydate.

24. Print all lines of mydate except those that have the letter “i” in them.

25. List the words of 4 letters from the file mydate.

26. List 5 states in north east India in a file mystates. List their corresponding capitals in a file
mycapitals. Use the paste command to join the 2 files.

27. Use the cut command to print the 1st and 3rd columns of the /etc/passwd file for all
students in this class.

28. Count the number of people logged in and also trap the users in a file using the tee
command.
29. Convert the contents of mystates into uppercase.

30. Create any two files & display the common values between them.

APPLICATIONS:
1. To enable the user to communicate with the kernel through the command
interpreter.
2. Useful in Shell Programming.
